deadlocks could happen when a worker 1 wants locks 1 2 3 and worker 2 wants lock 1 2 3 and 4
if worker 1 gets 1 and 2 and worker 2 gets locks 3 and 4 worker 1 is waiting on worker 2 to release lock 3
and worker 2 is waiting on worker 1 to realease locks 2 and 1.
To prevent this we set up a queue let a worker see if they can grab all the locks they need to complete their task
if yes they take all the locks at once then release them one at a time as they are done with them
if no then they dont grab any of the locks and go to the back of the queue and wait again for their turn.
this does result in some programs missing their turn and groups of workers falling behind.
to minimize this decrease in paralellism the queue is what is being used to make sure every worker gets a turn and that
no one team can starve out other colors. Even with that in most program runs one group is usally 2-3 workers behind the rest

another deadlock could happen if two groups try to use the conveyor belts at once. To eliminate this a worker is granted mutial
exlcusion on the entire conveyor belt network so they move the package to the next section  and continue with processing.
